#Project description

The visualisations shows information on the traffic of the bike sharing system in Budapest. 

Net demand (bikes returned - bikes taken) in every half hour for each station is showed during one day.
The size of the circles indicate the size of the net demand while the color shows whether the net demand is positive (green) or negative(red).

By clicking the play button transition starts from the beggining of the day towards the end of the day. 
By changing the value of the range selector one can stop the transition and select a particular time to be showed.
